#Partition; Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x 
#come before all nodes greater than or equal tox. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after 
#the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear 
#between the left and right partitions.
